#### Explanation on Data Sourcing
For the __Recommended Dietary Allowances and Adequate Intakes__ (vitamins, Elements, Water, Macronutrients), the __Tolerable Upper Intake Levels__ (vitamins, minerals), the __Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges__, and the __Additional Macronutrient Recommendations__; two primary sources were used _(as specified below)_. Note that newer data _(from the 2011 publication)_ and data that was filled in _(non-NULL)_ was preferred when combining sources.
